						
key model parameters:						
the expected return, R, on the inital investment X is a function of the holding period t						
denote the holding period t as a time period in seconds						
for various values of t, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, etc., we need to construct the function R(t), which represents the change in betfair odds over the time period t						
define R(t) conservatively as the difference between the offer price when we "back" it and the bid price when we lay it						
define theta as d(R(t))/dt ; i.e the slope of the function r(t)						
we want to estimate the slope of the function R(t) - the slope of this function defines our expected return over time period t in the outcome that the implementation of our trading strategy is successful						
						
hypothesis:						
The slope of the function R(t) exhibits maximum steepness in the time period shortly after a goal has been scored in a football match. 						
We expect that observations of empirical data will confirm that the "postgoaltheta" is abnormally large. 						
This may be driven by stopping out of positions in the over/under markets in the short period of time immediately after a goal.						
We do not believe that the slope of the curve reflects any fundamental effects, such as goal clustering in football matches.						
The empirical data confirms that goal clustering is not observable in football markets - rather, goals behave more like independent events.						
For the purposes of this analysis we treat goals as independent events.						
						
We believe that there is an opportunity to generate a positive alpha trading strategy by "selling theta" in the event of a goal in a football match.						
We implement this strategy by "backing" under x.5 goals in the short period following a goal; and laying x.5 goals after a holding period t.						
						
Our trading strategy will generate positive expected returns if the following criteria are satsified:						
						
probability of success (p(t)) * expected return over time horizon t (r(t)) - probability of failure (q(t)) * expected loss given failure (l(X)) > 0						
						
notation:						
define the holding period, t, as a time in seconds						
we denote the probability of success, which is a function of the holding period t, as p(t)						
define q(t) as the probability of failure, which is 1 - p(t)						
the expected return over time horizon t is the theta, d(R(t))/dt						
the expected loss given failure is a fraction of the initial investment, X, which we call l(X)						
						
estimation of the probability of success and, following that, the breakeven value of expected theta						
p(t) can be estimated by using historical data and pre match odds.						
						
for example, given that time t0 = 35 mins; we can estimate p(t) for Arsenal vs Chelsea using historical data on times when goals have been scored.						
						
lets suppose t1 - t0 = 5 mins in this example; we will estimate with different values of t in other examples and generalize						
						
then we are computing p(300) as t is defined in seconds						
						
based on last season's expected number of goals per time period; between 31 and 40 mins; for Arsenal the expected number of goals was 0.45 and for Chelsea 0.34						
for the purposes of this computation we take the average, 0.395, as the expected number of goals in this 10 min window.						
Hence, for a 5 min window, the expected number of goals is 						0.1975
						
hence the probability of failure, q(300) is 0.1975						
which implies that p(success) = p(300) = 0.8025						
						
assume, in this simplified example, that 90% of the capital is lost in the event of failure; hence only 10% is kept						
						
then we can compute the breakeven value of theta decay over 5 minutes using the information above - assume here that initial capital, X = 1						
0.8025 *R(300)*1 - 0.1975 * 0.9*1 = 0						
						
R(300) is the difference between the odds at time 0 and the odds at time t = 300 seconds; as per the definition at the top of the page.						
						
hence we need R(300) = 0.1975*0.9/0.8025 = 					0.221495327102804	
						
so if we "backed" at 2.3, we would need to lay at 					2.0785046728972	or better after t = 300 seconds in order to generate positive expected return.
